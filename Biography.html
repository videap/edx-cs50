                    <p>I was born in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in the year of 1990. Oddly enough, I have an identical twin, who actually is very good looking.</p>
                    <p>Since I was a child, I was very curious, and I still am. Over the years I have taught myself to do many interesting things, such as playing guitar, cooking, philosophy, and everything that I know about technology. In other words, studying has become one of my favorites hobbies.</p>
                    <p>I have a very nice family, with a lot of people. In order to know them better, see the table below:</p>

                    <p>When I was 17 years I moved out for studying with some of my childhood friends. We lived together in 4 different houses for 9 awesome years.</p>
                    <p>This was a period with lots of studies,work, learnings, and also laughter.</p>
                    <p>Now I live with my brother, have a girlfriend and work with IT. I am a [so called] solution engineer for Oracle, this huge tech company. Most of the time I design, assess, and improve cloud systems and applications.</p>
                    <p>For my work, and for a hobby, I believe the full stack development is very desirable. And this is how I got here!</p>
