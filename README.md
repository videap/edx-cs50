### Files

#### pallete.scss
Sass File with all CSS formatting. This template is used for all webpages, and almost every styling is configured here. Is called pallete because of the default pallete colors used as variables.

Other styling references are used additional to this file, such as Bootstrap (as required) and Google Fonts (for fonts stylyng). They are all referenced individually in the **head** section of the html files.

The "Menu" styling, presented in all web pages, is configured here with a media query, which changes itself to show small icons for responsive design.
