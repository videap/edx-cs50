        <h4>A weird list of weird stuff I find intereseting</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4 class="weird">Almost 163,000 pints of Guinness are wasted in moustaches each year.</h6></span>
                <p>An actual research study commissioned by Guinness found that an estimated 162,719 pints of Irish stout go to waste every year… via mustaches. The study found that 0.56 milliliters of Guinness get trapped in the average beard or mustache with each sip. And it takes about 10 sips to finish a pint.</p>
                <p>An estimated 92,370 Guinness consumers every year in the UK have facial hair. Assuming they consume on average 180 pints each a year, the total cost of wasted Guinness annually is about $536,000. The moral of this story? Shave and save!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4 class="weird">Janis Joplin left $2,500 in her will for her friends to have a party.</h6></span>
                <p>Article 11 of Janis Joplin's will included the stipulation that she wanted $2,500 of her estate set aside for a post-funeral party "at a suitable location as a final gesture of appreciation and farewell."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4 class="weird">Squirrels are behind most power outages in the U.S.</h6></span>
                <p>Typically, the squirrels cause problems by tunneling, chewing through electrical insulation, or becoming a current path between electrical conductors. "Frankly, the number one threat experienced to date by the U.S. electrical grid is squirrels," said John C. Inglis, the former deputy director of the National Security Agency, in 2015.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4 class="weird">A cloud can weigh more than a million pounds.</h6></span>
                <p>Clouds are not as light and fluffy as they appear. In fact, researchers have found that a single cloud weighs about 1.1 million pounds. How do they know? Well, that number is calculated by taking the water density of a cloud and multiplying it by its volume. Fortunately, the cloud can still "float" at that weight because the air below it is even heavier.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4 class="weird">The Apollo 11 crew used hundreds of autographs as life insurance.</h6></span>
                <p>Neil Armstrong and the Apollo 11 crew faced the real chance that they wouldn't return from the moon safely, leaving their families without financial support. Due to the extreme danger that they were about to face, they couldn't take out life insurance policies. So instead, they signed hundreds of autographs, which their families would have been able to sell if they didn't make it home. Luckily, those life insurance autographs weren't needed. They do, however, show up in space memorabilia auctions today, selling for as much as $30,000.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4 class="weird">A New Orleans hotel offered a $15,000 stay to a whoever stole the "most outrageous" item from them.</h6></span>
                <p>In March 2019, the Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans decided to celebrate its 125th anniversary by offering a free seven-night stay in its presidential suite, along with complimentary private dinners and spa treatments worth a whopping $15,000. But this wasn't a standard giveaway: The prize was only available to the person who returned the "most outrageous" item ever stolen from the hotel.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4 class="weird">The Queen owns all the swans in England.</h6></span>
                <p>According to British law, any unclaimed swan swimming in the open waters of England and Wales belongs to the Queen. The law originated in medieval times when swans were a delicacy for the wealthy, but it still stands today. Queen Elizabeth II also upholds a centuries-old tradition with the swans: Every year during the third week of July, all the swans in the River Thames are counted for the Queen in a practice called "Swan Upping."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4 class="weird">A meteor exploded over Earth with the force of 10 atomic bombs and everyone missed it.</h6></span>
                <p>You'd think if a spacial body met a phenomenally fiery fate right above our heads, we'd notice. But when a meteor hit our atmosphere on Dec. 18, 2018, and exploded with a force that was 10 times the energy of the Hiroshima atomic bomb, it wasn't discovered by NASA scientists until after the fact. Turns out, it went largely undetected because it took place over the Bering Sea in an area that was close, but not directly on, the path of commercial planes flying between North America and Asia.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4 class="weird">Spider webs were used as bandages in ancient times.</h6></span>
                <p>In ancient Greece and Rome, doctors used spider webs to make bandages for their patients. Spider webs supposedly have natural antiseptic and anti-fungal properties, which can help keep wounds clean and prevent infection. It's also said that spider webs are rich in vitamin K, which helps promote clotting. So, next time you're out of Band-Aids, just head to your attic and grab some "webicillin."</p>

            <li>
                <h4 class="weird">At least one of the colors of the Olympic flag appears on all the national flags.</h6></span>
                <p>Fresh aristocrat Baron de Coubertin designed the Olympic flag in the early 1900s, and he was very intentional with his creation. At least one of the colors on the Olympic flag appears on the flags of every nation that competed in the games at the time (but only if you count the white background of the flag itself). "A white background, with five interlaced rings in the center: blue, yellow, black, green, and red … is symbolic," Coubertin said in 1931. "It represents the five inhabited continents of the world, united by Olympism, while the six colors are those that appear on all the national flags of the world at the present time."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4 class="weird">You're more likely to get a computer virus from visiting religious sites than porn sites.</h6></span>
                <p>According to research from security firm Symantec, religious websites carry three times more malware threats than pornography sites. Symantec found that the average number of security threats on religious sites was around 115, compared to adult content sites which carried around 25. In fact, only 2.4 percent of adult sites were infected with malware. The researchers hypothesized that's because porn sites need to generate a profit, so there's a financial incentive to keeping them virus-free to encourage repeat business.</p>
